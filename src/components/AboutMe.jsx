      <p> Hi, I'mDominick Keeling. I am specializing in Fullstack Development and currently in my 5th and final trimester at Atlas School. My favorite language to work with is JavaScript. I also enjoy working with n8n, a powerful workflow automation tool that allows me to create workflows to automate tasks, such as integrating APIs, processing data, and managing complex processes, and which has been invaluable in my internship. I've even had the opportunity to dip my feet in automation engineering by automating the process of shipping and labeling products for one of our clients. After school, I plan to start my ownLLC, where I will begin by creating websites for clients and later expand to building apps and software. Outside of school and work, I enjoy sand volleyball, disc golf, wrestling/jujitsu, and havinggame nights with friends.</p>
